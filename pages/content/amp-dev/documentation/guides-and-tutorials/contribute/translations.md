Welcome to the AMP Translation Initiative!

AMP's mission includes making the web a welcoming and accessible place for everyone, and we are unable to obtain this goal without localized documentation. Translating AMP documentation is an essential process that aids the AMP community's success and health.

The AMP Translation Initiative is working to create a network of native speakers to ensure our documentation is localized with clarity and efficiency. We can't thank you for taking an interest in AMP and your assistance in making the web a content ecosystem for everyone.

## Ways to Contribute

  * Translate documentation.
  * Update translated documentation.
  * Review translated documentation for accuracy and terminology.
  * Add to localization term glossaries.

## Get Started

AMP has an ongoing internal translation process for documentation. We are working with contributors to form a communication line that describes what files are being translated and which ones require external assistance.

### Currently, our process is:

  1. Find a file to translate.
  1. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/issues/new).
    * Declare into which language you're translating the document.
    * Name which file you wish to translate or update.
    * Give a rough estimation of how much of the file you are translating.
        - Full File
        - Partial File
        - Few Terms
    * Provide a general estimation of how much time it will take to complete the translation task.
    * Add [@CrystalOnScript](https://github.com/CrystalOnScript) so she can triage the localization request and inform you in case there's already somebody working on the same translation:
        - Yes! Please translate this!
        - Thanks for your interest, but the internal team or a volunteer is currently working on this document. You will be added as a reviewer before it goes live.

Some volunteer translators have created channels on Slack where a localized documentation tracker has been created. We encourage you to join and introduce yourself!

### Creating localized files

The [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) website differentiates localized files by suffixing the `@` symbol followed by the appropriate language code to the translated document. For example, `example.md` would become `example@ko.md` if translated to Korean.
